\begin{abstract}
In the past few years, there has been an explosion of interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) for a variety of practical applications. Much of this explosion has been driven by the invention of the Transformer architecture. However, the Transformer architecture inner workings largely remain a mystery. Combining this with the applications that LLMs are finding in the real-world, there a variety of new security risks that these LLMs open
up their users to. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of LLMs to random bitflips in the variables, pinpointing specific parts of the LLM that are vulnerable to these hardware errors.

\section{Introduction}

In the past few years, there has been an explosion of interest in LLMs with the creation of widely available resources like OpenAI's ChatGPT
and Meta's open source Llama. Much of the explosion has been driven by the creation of the transformer architecture, which has made a dramatic difference throughout AI, but particularly in the world of LLMs. However, our fundamental understanding of how these objects remains shrouded in mystery.

Because of our lack of understanding of how these objects work, and the quick assimilation of these products into our daily lives, there are a variety of novel security risks that we are being introduced to. One specific error is not so common, but still of practical relevance, is a hardware failure in which a random bitflip occurs in the parameters of our model. An error of such a fashion could have drastic effects on our output, ranging from making the outputs gibberish to outright wrong.

In this paper, we analyze how injecting bit errors into specific locations of a transformer and the LLM model as a whole affect the output. To this end, we use the \{INSERT MODEL\} as a base model to test on. To inject errors into our base model we use the PyTEI package \cite{Ma23}. To quantify the effect of our errors, we compare the score of our base model to the score of the models with errors injected using the \{INSERT TESTS\}.

\section{First Level Heading}

First level headings are all flush left, initial caps, bold and in point
size 12. One line space before the first level heading and $1/2$ line
space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Second Level Heading}

Second level headings must be flush left, initial caps, bold and in point
size 10. One line space before the second level heading and $1/2$ line
space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}

Third level headings must be flush left, initial caps and bold.
One line space before the third level heading and $1/2$ line
space after the third level heading.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps and roman type.
One line space before the fourth level heading and $1/2$ line
space after the fourth level heading.

\subsection{Citations In Text}

Citations within the text should indicate the author's last name and
year\cite{Knuth-vol3}. Reference style\cite{Comer-btree}
should follow the style that you are used to using, as long as the
citation style is consistent.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{This is a sample footnote} in
the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page they appear on.
Precede the footnote with a vertical rule of 2 inches (12 picas).

\subsubsection{Figures}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use pencil
or hand-drawn artwork. Figure number and caption always appear after the
the figure. Place one line space before the figure, one line space
before the figure caption and one line space after the figure caption.
The figure caption is initial caps and each figure is numbered
consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page to avoid
splitting the figure and figure caption.

Figure \ref{fig1} shows how to include a figure as encapsulated postscript.
The source of the figure is in file {\tt fig1.eps}.

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use pencil
or hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear before the
table.

One line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|r|}
\hline
A & B & 1\\ \hline
C & D & 2\\

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Handling References}

Use a first level heading for the references. References follow the
acknowledgements.


\subsubsection{Acknowledgements}

Use a third level heading for the acknowledgements. All acknowledgements
go at the end of the paper.
